A CLI app which establishes a connection to a private Google Cloud Redis instance and port-forwards it to a local machine.

Connection is established by running an https://www.stunnel.org/[stunnel] pod in a Google Kubernetes Engine cluster which runs in the same VPC network as the private Cloud Redis instance. Connection is then port-forwarded to the local machine, where a user can connect to the instance on localhost. Configurations in the app can be saved for practical future usage.

The app relies on local `gcloud` and `kubectl` commands which have to be configured and authenticated with the proper Google Cloud user and GKE Kubernetes cluster.

The app also needs an existing Kubernetes Secret containing the Google Cloud Redis certificate to exist in the Kubernetes 
cluster. You can download a Redis certificate file and create a Kubernetes secret manually, or you can use
`google-cloud-redis secrets create` command to do so.
